This repository provides a **reproducible, modular machine-learning workflow** for building a **data-driven functional-group atlas** that enables *predictable programming* of **carbon–molten salt interfacial wettability and heat transport** for thermal energy storage.

The core idea is to **deconstruct functional-group effects into two orthogonal feature dimensions**:

- **Elemental / bonding descriptors** → dominate *interfacial wettability* (quantified by adsorption/binding affinity, **Eb**).
- **Geometric / topological descriptors** → dominate *interfacial heat transport potential* (quantified by low-frequency phonon spectral matching, **NVOA**).

This repo focuses on the **machine-learning part of the workflow**: hierarchical feature engineering, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, stacking ensemble construction, rigorous repeated cross-validation, SHAP-based interpretation (including a **Two-Level Weighted SHAP** strategy), and high-throughput prediction for a broader candidate space.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Dual-Target Learning (Eb & NVOA)** 🎯  
  Train and interpret **two independent models** for interfacial wettability (Eb) and thermal transport potential (NVOA).

- **Hierarchical Feature Engineering** 🛠️  
  A rigorous three-stage selection strategy:
  1) **Filter**: remove highly correlated features (Pearson threshold) using **Mutual Information** (default) or Pearson-to-target criterion  
  2) **Embedded**: SHAP-driven coarse screening with a Random Forest  
  3) **Wrapper**: SHAP-driven recursive elimination with **early stopping** to locate the optimal feature set

- **Efficient Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization** ⚡  
  Uses Bayesian optimization (scikit-optimize) to tune multiple tree-based regressors efficiently.

- **High-Performance Stacking Ensemble** 🧠  
  Builds a two-layer stacking model:
  - **Level-0**: heterogeneous tree learners (e.g., RF/ETR/GBRT/HGBR/XGB/LGBM/CBR)
  - **Level-1 meta-learner**: **ElasticNet** (regularized linear combiner)

- **Rigorous Robustness Evaluation** 🔁  
  Repeated evaluation across many random seeds (default **100**) with outer K-fold CV, reducing split-induced contingencies.

- **Interpretable “Two-Level Weighted SHAP”** 📊  
  Produces a more stable global importance ranking by weighting:
  - within-fold SHAP by **1/RMSE of base learners**
  - across folds by **1/RMSE of stacking meta-learner**

- **One-Click Prediction for New Candidates** 🧪  
  Predict Eb/NVOA for unseen functional-group candidates from an Excel sheet, exporting full results to Excel/CSV.

## 📜 Script A: Feature Engineering (`Feature engineering-FGA.ipynb`)

### 🎯 What it does
- Loads `Original database-FGA.xlsx`
- Extracts features by slice and selects the target by column index
- Runs a 3-stage feature selection pipeline:
  - **Stage 1 (Filter)**: Pearson correlation pruning (default threshold `0.8`) using **Mutual Information** to decide which feature to keep in a correlated pair
  - **Stage 2 (Embedded)**: Random Forest + SHAP coarse screening (default keep top `80%`)
  - **Stage 3 (Wrapper)**: SHAP-guided iterative elimination with **early stopping** (default patience `50`)

### ✅ Default configuration (edit at top of notebook)
- `INPUT_FILE = 'Original database-FGA.xlsx'`
- `OUTPUT_DIR = 'feature_engineering_output'`
- `FEATURE_COLUMN_SLICE = '1:-2'`  (features exclude last two cols)
- `TARGET_COLUMN_INDEX = -1`       (choose last col as target by default)
- `FILTER_METHOD_CRITERION = 'mutual_info'`
- `PEARSON_CORR_THRESHOLD = 0.8`

### ▶️ How to run for **both targets**
Run the notebook twice:

1. **For NVOA**
   - keep `TARGET_COLUMN_INDEX = -1`
   - run all cells → get `feature_engineering_output/Final_Selected_Dataset_*.xlsx`
   - rename to `Final_engineered_dataset-FGA-NVOA.xlsx`

2. **For Eb**
   - set `TARGET_COLUMN_INDEX = -2`
   - run all cells → get another `Final_Selected_Dataset_*.xlsx`
   - rename to `Final_engineered_dataset-FGA-Eb.xlsx`

### 📄 Outputs
All outputs go to `feature_engineering_output/`, including:

- correlation matrices at different stages
- process summary Excel
- iterative performance history Excel
- **Final selected dataset** (core output):  
  `Final_Selected_Dataset_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx`

### Environment Configuration

**⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE:** For academic review or users who need to reproduce the results from our paper as closely as possible, **it is highly recommended to use Option 1**. Using Option 2 or 3 is more likely to produce numerical differences in the output, even with identical code and random seeds. This is primarily due to the following reasons:

1.  **Dependency Solver Ambiguity** 🧩: `environment.yml` and `requirements.txt` files allow the dependency solver (Conda or Pip) to select different versions of underlying sub-dependencies over time.
2.  **Platform-Specific Builds** 💻: Even with identical package versions, the underlying compiled libraries (e.g., Intel MKL vs. OpenBLAS) can differ across operating systems, causing minute variations in floating-point calculations.
3.  **Sensitivity of Stochastic Optimization** 🎲: This project utilizes Bayesian Optimization. The minor computational variations from the points above can influence the optimization trajectory, leading to different hyperparameter choices and, consequently, different final results.
4.  **Stochasticity from Parallel Computing** ⚡: To accelerate computations, the script may utilize parallel processing (e.g., via `n_jobs=-1`). However, when computations are executed across multiple CPU cores, the precise order of floating-point operations can vary slightly, which can be amplified by iterative algorithms.
